GBIF's national and organizational members—formally known as [Participants](/the-gbif-network)—represent governments and institutions from around the world. Our network also includes [hundreds of institutions that publish biodiversity data](/publisher/search) along with volunteers who participate in the growing number of [citizen science](/citizen-science) programmes around the world.

### Who can join

The GBIF [Memorandum of Understanding](/mou) (MOU) defines members' formal relationships with the network. Under the terms of the MOU, Participants can be 

+ a country
+ an economy
+ an intergovernmental or international organization
+ an organization with an international scope

Members must sign the MOU and express their intention to observe its provisions. 

A country becomes a Participant in GBIF through signature of the GBIF Memorandum of Understanding, a voluntary non‐binding instrument in which countries agree to general principles of free and open access to biodiversity data. Signature may come from a minister or senior official in a relevant government department or designated national agency.  

### Why join? What are the benefits of GBIF membership?

For governments, formal participation in GBIF provides its ministry staff and researchers with a range of formal and informal collaborations with an international community whose professional and technical expertise can help to fulfil national biodiversity information needs and commitments. Opportunities include:
1. Participation in mentoring and training projects under the [GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme](/programme/82219/capacity-enhancement-support-programme)
2. Participation in programmes like [BID](/programme/bid) (Biodiversity Information for Development) and [BIFA](/programme/bifa) (Biodiversity Information Fund for Asia)
3. Development of [regional collaborations and strategies](/the-gbif-network)
4. Establishment of working relationships with other GBIF Participants and the Secretariat
5. Open-access information resources and tools for developing a national biodiversity information facility

Participants **integrate primary biodiversity data mobilized from their own collections and observer networks** with those data already shared from other countries through GBIF. Researchers and decision makers can then access and use best-available evidence to addressing national biodiversity priorities.

GBIF members that mobilize data from national institutions help the country meet its obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), in particular Aichi Target 19 on the sharing of biodiversity knowledge, which in turn supports a range of other targets including 
+ Target 9 (invasive species)
+ Target 11 (protected areas)
+ Target 12 (avoiding extinctions)
+ Target 13 (conserving genetic resources)

Data made accessible by GBIF members also contributes towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through applications beyond conservation, for example informing policies related to food security, livelihoods, human health and impacts of climate change. GBIF member countries are also better able to contribute data towards the IPBES Regional Assessments and to fill data gaps identified through the assessment process. 

The national and organizational nodes responsible for coordinating biodiversity data mobilization and use collaborate with the GBIF network at regional and global levels. In such settings node staff gain access to skills and training as well while sharing professional knowledge and experience, best practices and  strategies for putting open-access data to use in research and policy. Guidance for establishing effective nodes is summarized and documented in [English](/document/80925/), [French](/document/82147), [Spanish](/document/82186) and [Portuguese](/document/82231). 

GBIF's national members often maintain their own open-access websites and data portals. These tools can help inform scientists, researchers, citizens and policy makers about local biodiversity while supporting international commitments and requirements for biodiversity information and knowledge.

### How to join

#### 1. Choose the appropriate category of membership

GBIF has three types of Participants. The first two apply to countries, the third to all other organizations.

+ **Voting Participants** are countries that observe the provisions of the MOU and make a financial contribution to the annual GBIF budget. These Participants have voting rights on the GBIF Governing Board, as well as other benefits.
+ **Associate Country Participants** are not yet making financial contributions to GBIF. Associate Participants may take part in Governing Board discussions but may not vote. Countries can maintain Associate Participant status temporarily for up to five years after the MOU signing date. During this period, a country may choose to become a Voting Participant, an Observer, or may withdraw from GBIF. 
+ **Other Associate Participants** are international organizations, intergovernmental organizations, other organizations with an international scope, and economies, that are willing to observe the MoU provisions. Their representatives can attend the GBIF Governing Board, endorse data publishers and collaborate in regional meetings, mentoring and training programmes and other activities, but they are not eligible to become Voting Participants, and are not required to make financial contributions.

#### 2. Send a Letter of Intent

In order to become a Participant in GBIF, an appropriate government agency, or senior representative of an organization, should send an official Letter of Intent to the Chair of the Governing Board (see templates below), expressing intent to sign the MoU.

+ [Letter of intent template for **countries**](/resource/80857)
+ [Letter of intent template for **organizations**](/resource/80858)

The letter should state that the country/organization is, in principle, in agreement with the intentions listed in the MoU and should, in particular, outline the willingness to establish a Participant Node, share biodiversity data and actively participate in the implementation of the GBIF Work Programme.

Letters of Intent signed by a Minister or ministerial department should include information on the agency or institution that has been designated to sign the MoU and represent the country on the GBIF Governing Board.

If a country wishes to become a Voting Participant it must, in addition, express its willingness to make a financial contribution to GBIF as outlined in Paragraph 9 of the MoU, and establish the details in a financial arrangement with the Secretariat. 

The GBIF Executive Committee will consider all petitions for Participant status and will determine if the application meets the requirements of the MoU and GBIF Rules of Procedure. If a petition is granted, a MoU signature copy will be sent. In the case of Voting Participation, the Secretariat will in addition specify the financial contributions in a financial arrangement.

For further details of the procedure see Article IV – Requirements for Participation in the [Rules of Procedure](/resource/80667) agreed by the Governing Board.

Prospective members should address their letters of intent to:

> Chair of the GBIF Governing Board
GBIF Secretariat
Universitetsparken 15
DK-2100 Copenhagen Ø
Denmark

#### 3. Sign the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

After the GBIF Executive Committee receives and approves the petition to join GBIF as expressed in the letter of intent, the applicant will be informed, and the designated minister, official or other representative may sign the MoU. Upon receipt of the signed MOU, the country or organization becomes a GBIF Participant and will receive information about next steps, including the appointment of a Head of Delegation and a node manager.
